        In addition to a wide assortment of hand tools, members can check out a select number of electric power tools. For safety and liability reasons, we do not lend out gas-powered tools or tools that contain or use hazardous materials.

        Also, only members presenting valid member numbers can check out tools. You can’t share your membership or have others check out tools for you.
