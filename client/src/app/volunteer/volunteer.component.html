    Did you know that the tool library operates with no paid staff and is a 100% volunteer-driven effort? We are currently looking for more wonderful people to help out.

        Volunteers are needed to cover shifts on <strong>Saturdays 9-2 and Tuesdays and Wednesdays 5:30pm-7:30pm</strong>.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        Shifts are about 2-3 hours long â€“ and there is always another volunteer to help make the time fly by quickly.  Many of our volunteers sign up for one shift a month, which helps share the work and keep the tool library open.
      </p>
      <p class="text">
        You do not need any prior knowledge about tools, only a willingness to help out.  Who knows, you may just learn a few things about home repair yourself!  It is also a great way to meet your NE neighbors and connect with the community. Volunteers must be at least 16 years old to volunteer.
      </p>

        Check out our Online Calendar for available shift openings and email volunteer(at)neptl(dot)org if you would like to sign up for a shift!
