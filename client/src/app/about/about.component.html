  <h3>What is a tool library?</h3>
  <p class="text">
    Tool libraries are just like traditional libraries, but with tools instead of books.  They are great for people who can’t/don’t want to buy/rent tools they are only going to use once in a while.

        The Northeast Portland Tool Library (NEPTL) is your neighborhood tool library.  We lend out free of charge an ever-growing inventory of home-repair and gardening tools to Northeast residents and community groups.
