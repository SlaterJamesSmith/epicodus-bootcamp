# _EPICODUS - INTRO WEEK 2: Solo Project_

#### _Epicodus Program-Track Matchmaker, March 23, 2018_

#### _By Mike Chu_

## Description

_This website project is a practice in the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with a focus on jQuery and branching. Prospective Epicodus students are asked to rate themselves according to their current technical aptitude, learning attitude, and interests in coding/programming. The students' inputs are then scored and passed through a network of checks to determine an appropriate course recommendation. Lower aptitude scores rely heavily on learning attitudes to select a recommendation while higher aptitude scores tend to rely more on interests to select a recommendation._
