# Epicodus Program Track Suggester

**Epicodus Solo Project | Intro | Week 2 | March 23, 2018**

**By Mike Chu**

## Description

Prospective Epicodus students are asked to rate themselves according to their current technical aptitude, learning attitude, and interests in coding/programming. The students' inputs are then scored and passed through a network of checks to determine an appropriate course recommendation. Lower aptitude scores rely heavily on learning attitudes while higher aptitude scores rely more on interests to select a recommendation.
