#### _Arrays & Looping Practice Project, March 28, 2018_

#### _By Mike Chu & Matt Miller_

## Description

_This project is a practice in JavaScript Arrays & Looping._
* _The program does nothing to non-alphabetical characters, since they do not contain consonants or vowels._
* _The program adds "way" to single-letter words beginning with a vowel._
* _The program will move the first consonant to the end of a word and add "ay"._
* _The program will treat "y" as a consonant moving it to the end of a word and adding "ay"._
* _The program will move all sequential consonants at the beginning of a word to the end of a word and add "ay"._
* _If the first consonants include "qu," the program will move all first consonants including "qu" to the end of a word and add "ay"._
* _The program will translate characters regardless of case._
* _The program will translate multiple words._
