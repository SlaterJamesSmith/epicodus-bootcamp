# Robot Dance Party

## Description

A CSS animation project focused on replicating Adobe After Effects' parenting and layering techniques to create a robot dance party!

The robot rig was designed using a hierarchy of parented "joints" and "limbs" to help create a predictable system of motion as well as normalize transformations. When parent elements move, child elements follow along. When a child element compounds its parental motions with its own, interesting patterns can emerge.

The robot dance groups are contained in separate frames, which are treated like layered assets in a single composition. Each layer can be independently manipulated to produce additional effects like simulated 3-dimensional motion.
