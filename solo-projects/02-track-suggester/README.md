## Description

An application designed to help prospective Epicodus students determine which program track best suits their current technical aptitude, learning attitude, and interests in coding/programming.

Users submit a selection of self-defining statements, which are then scored and passed through a network of checks to determine an appropriate course recommendation. Lower aptitude scores rely heavily on learning attitudes while higher aptitude scores rely more on interests to select a recommendation.
